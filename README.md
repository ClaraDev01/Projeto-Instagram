## Instagram-Project

This project is a replica of the Instagram homepage layout, developed as part of a coding challenge. The goal was to faithfully reproduce the design provided in Figma, ensuring accuracy in colors, dimensions, and typography.

## 🚀*Technologies Used*  

- *HTML5* – For semantic and structured markup  
- *CSS3* – For styling and layout  
- *Google Fonts (Roboto)* – Ensuring the correct typography  
- *IonIcons* – For icons used throughout the layout  
- *CodeSandbox* (Optional) – For development and testing  

## 🎯*Requirements Met*  

- ✅ *Semantic HTML5 Structure* – Clean and accessible markup  
- ✅ *CSS3 Styling* – Matches the original Figma design  
- ✅ *Google Fonts Usage* – Ensuring typography consistency  
- ✅ *IonIcons Usage* – For icon consistency across the layout
- ✅ *Structured Assets* – Images and icons are organized in proper directories  
- ✅ *Responsive Design* – Layout adapts to mobile and desktop views  
- ✅ *Overflow Property* – Used to ensure the stories section does not display horizontal scroll while maintaining layout integrity. Excess items that overflow should be hidden without showing horizontal scrollbars.
